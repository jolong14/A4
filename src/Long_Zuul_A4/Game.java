/**
 *  This class is the main class of the "World of Zuul" application.
 *  "World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  Users
 *  can walk around some scenery. That's all. It should really be extended
 *  to make it more interesting!
 *
 *  UPDATE 4/3: Player is trapped in a "haunted" house and must escape.  Changed map layout,
 *  names of rooms, and printWelcome to match current game scenario.
 *
 *  UPDATE 4/12: Updated the Long_Zuul_A4.Game class by changing the goRoom(called the getLocationInfo
 *  method) and createRoom(changed to conform with the setExit method) methods and
 *  added the printLocationInfo method.  Updated the Long_Zuul_A4.Room class by adding the getExit,
 *  setExit, getExitString, and getLongDescription methods, and removed the setExits method.
 *
 *  UPDATE 4/17: Added items to the rooms, added a look and pickup command, added a showCommands method
 *  that prints the list of valid commands from the Long_Zuul_A4.CommandWords class.
 *
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method.
 *
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
